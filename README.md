**Algorithm** - Is a finite set of well-defined instruction for accomplishing some task
###characteristics of an algorithm
- Algorithms should have explicitly defined set of inputs and outputs
- Algorithms are well-ordered with unambiguous operations
- Algorithms halt in a finite amount of time. Algorithms should not run for infinity,
i.e., an algorithm must end at some point
