# Data-structure-and-algorith-java

**Algorithm** - Is a finite set of well-defined instruction for accomplishing some task
###characteristics of an algorithm
- Algorithms should have explicitly defined set of inputs and outputs
- Algorithms are well-ordered with unambiguous operations
- Algorithms halt in a finite amount of time. Algorithms should not run for infinity,
i.e., an algorithm must end at some point

### Types of datastructures



- Linear : _Include **[arrays](./src/datastructures/linear/arrays/arrays.md)**, **[linked list](./src/datastructures/linear/linkedlist/linkedlist.md)**, **[stacks](./src/datastructures/linear/stack/stack.md)**, **[queue](./src/datastructures/linear/queue/queue.md)**, **[Hashmaps](./src/datastructures/linear/hashmaps/hasmaps.md)**_
- No-linear: _Include **[Trees](./src/datastructures/nonelinear/trees/tress.md)**, **[Graphs](./src/datastructures/nonelinear/graphs/graphs.md)**_
